    "If you want to get into machine learning, recurrent neural networks are a powerful technique that is important to understand. If you use a smartphone or frequently surf the internet, odd’s are you’ve used applications that leverages RNN’s. Recurrent neural networks are used in speech recognition, language translation, stock predictions; It’s even used in image recognition to describe the content in pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I know there are many guides on recurrent neural networks, but I want to share illustrations along with an explanation, of how I came to understand it. I’m going to avoid all the math and focus on the intuition behind RNNs instead. By the end of this post, you should have a good understanding of RNN’s and hopefully, have that light bulb moment."

    "Ok so RNN’s are neural networks that are good at modeling sequence data. To understand what that means let’s do a thought experiment. Say you take a still snapshot of a ball moving in time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s also say you want to predict the direction that the ball was moving. So with only the information that you see on the screen, how would you do this? Well, you can go ahead and take a guess, but any answer you’d come up with would be that, a random guess. Without knowledge of where the ball has been, you wouldn’t have enough data to predict where it’s going.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you record many snapshots of the ball’s position in succession, you will have enough information to make a better prediction.\n",

    "At first, you’ll struggle with the first few letters, but then after your brain picks up the pattern, the rest will come naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is a very logical reason why this can be difficult. You learn the alphabet as a sequence. Sequential memory is a mechanism that makes it easier for your brain to recognize sequence patterns."

Last you pass the output to the feedforward layer, and it returns a prediction. And that’s it! The control flow of doing a forward pass of a recurrent neural network is a for loop.\n"

    "## Vanishing Gradient\n",

    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/276/1*yQzlE7JseW32VVU-xlOUvQ.png)  Final hidden state of the RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term memory is caused by the infamous vanishing gradient problem, which is also prevalent in other neural network architectures. As the RNN processes more steps, it has troubles retaining information from previous steps. As you can see, the information from the word “what” and “time” is almost non-existent at the final time step. Short-Term memory and the vanishing gradient is due to the nature of back-propagation; an algorithm used to train and optimize neural networks. To understand why this is, let’s take a look at the effects of back propagation on a deep feed-forward neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training a neural network has three major steps. First, it does a forward pass and makes a prediction. Second, it compares the prediction to the ground truth using a loss function. The loss function outputs an error value which is an estimate of how poorly the network is performing. Last, it uses that error value to do back propagation which calculates the gradients for each node in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*8eriEDJZisidMG_yyEDEAA.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient is the value used to adjust the networks internal weights, allowing the network to learn. The bigger the gradient, the bigger the adjustments and vice versa. Here is where the problem lies. When doing back propagation, each node in a layer calculates it’s gradient with respect to the effects of the gradients, in the layer before it. So if the adjustments to the layers before it is small, then adjustments to the current layer will be even smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "That causes gradients to exponentially shrink as it back propagates down. The earlier layers fail to do any learning as the internal weights are barely being adjusted due to extremely small gradients. And that’s the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*nGrmK1Ikx7ecZZyTdOCIuQ.gif)  Gradients shrink as it back-propagates down\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how this applies to recurrent neural networks. You can think of each time step in a recurrent neural network as a layer. To train a recurrent neural network, you use an application of back-propagation called back-propagation through time. The gradient values will exponentially shrink as it propagates through each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*Ku54qmCryZVBaIc6g8rjGA.gif) Gradients shrink as it back-propagates through time\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the gradient is used to make adjustments in the neural networks weights thus allowing it to learn. Small gradients mean small adjustments. That causes the early layers not to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of vanishing gradients, the RNN doesn’t learn the long-range dependencies across time steps. That means that there is a possibility that the word “what” and “time” are not considered when trying to predict the user’s intention. The network then has to make the best guess with “is it?”. That’s pretty ambiguous and would be difficult even for a human. So not being able to learn on earlier time steps causes the network to have a short-term memory."

    "## LSTM’s and GRU’s\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so RNN’s suffer from short-term memory, so how do we combat that? To mitigate short-term memory, two specialized recurrent neural networks were created. One called Long Short-Term Memory or LSTM’s for short. The other is Gated Recurrent Units or GRU’s. LSTM’s and GRU’s essentially function just like RNN’s, but they’re capable of learning long-term dependencies using mechanisms called “gates.” These gates are different tensor operations that can learn what information to add or remove to the hidden state. Because of this ability, short-term memory is less of an issue for them. If you’d like to learn more about LSTM’s and GRU’s you can view my post on them."

The short-term memory issue for vanilla RNN’s doesn’t mean to skip them entirely and use the more evolved versions like LSTM’s or GRU’s. RNN’s have the benefit of training faster and uses less computational resources. That’s because there are fewer tensor operations to compute. You should use LSTM’s or GRU’s when you expect to model longer sequences with long-term dependencies.\n",
